IT IS READY.

Note for developer: In order to set up the executable,
I have made your life the epitome of easy. Run this:
"python makeInstaller.py" VOILA THAT'S ALL. IT WILL
IMPORT EVERYTHING INTO THE dist/ folder and then you
have to run NSIS and compile the "installer.nsi" file
that has been created and you're ready!
